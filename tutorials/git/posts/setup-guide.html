Git is a powerful tool, but it has a reputation of baffling newcomers. It doesn’t help that most people are simply thrown in at the deep end and expected to swim. <br>
<br>
With the right knowledge, anyone can master git. Once you start to understand it, the terminology will make more sense and you’ll (eventually) learn to love it. Stay strong 🙏 <br>
<br>
First of all, GitHub is not git. Many people understandably confuse the two. GitHub is a website for hosting projects that use git. <br>
<br>
Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that makes it easier to track changes to files. For example, when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who changed it, and why.<br>
<br>
It’s useful for coordinating work among multiple people on a project, and for tracking progress over time by saving “checkpoints”. You could use it while writing an essay, or to track changes to artwork and design files.<br>
<br>
Git isn’t the only version control system out there, but it’s by far the most popular. Many software developers use git daily, and understanding how to use it can give a major boost to your resume.<br>
<br>
In complex projects, where multiple people might be making changes to the same files simultaneously, it’s easy to get into a weird state. Anyone who’s dealt with “merge conflicts” and those baffling >>>>>>> ======= <<<<<<< symbols can attest to this.<br>
<br>
If you start to understand how git works, you’ll see why conflicts occur and how to recover from these situations easily.
